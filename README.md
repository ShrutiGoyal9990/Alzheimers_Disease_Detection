# ALZHEIMERS DISEASE DETECTION
## 1. Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder causing cognitive decline, memory impairment, and behavioral changes. It is one of the most common causes for brain damage, responsible for 60-70% of all cases. According to WHO, over half a billion people worldwide are affected by dementia, making it the seventh foremost cause of death and dependency especially amongst the elderly population. As life expectancy rises, the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease is expected to increase significantly.

In the last few decades, machine learning (ML) has been recognized as a powerful technique for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease. ML algorithms can analyze complicated datasets like MRI images and numerical clinical data to identify underlying patterns and signs of disease. Advanced efforts to improve diagnosis accuracy and disease progression include Deep Learning (DL) and ensemble learning algorithms. The integration of ML and DL in Alzheimer's research aims to reduce diagnosis time while also discovering new biomarkers and treatment strategies to improve quality of life. 

## 2. About the Dataset

The dataset consists of Preprocessed MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) Images. All the images are resized into 128 x 128 pixels. The Dataset has four classes of images.
The Dataset is consists of total 6400 MRI images.

Class - 1: Mild Demented (896 images)

Class - 2: Moderate Demented (64 images)

Class - 3: Non Demented (3200 images)

Class - 4: Very Mild Demented (2240 images)

## 5. Conclusion
This project focuses on classifying preprocessed MRI scans of Alzheimer's patients into four distinct categories: Mild Demented, Moderate Demented, Non-Demented, and Very Mild Demented. It employs three different methods to accomplish this classification task. The CNN framework is achieving an exceptional accuracy rate of 99.22%. This high accuracy position of the model indicates its superior performance in accurately identifying different stages of Alzheimer's disease based on MRI image analysis. 

As a result, this system stands as a valuable tool, aiding neurologists in their diagnosis and assessment of Alzheimer's disease severity.
